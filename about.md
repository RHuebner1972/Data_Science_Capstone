This application is developed as part of the requirement for the Data Science Capstone course on Coursera.com. The goal of this project is to create a predictive text model and a R Shiny app that is able to predict the next word when the user types a sentence. This is similar to the way predicting text is implemented using Swiftkey.

### Steps
1. Upon initial load up of the application, you will see a NULL in the predicted word textbox. That's OK. 
2. You can enter the first few words of a sentence to begin the next word prediction.


### Results
1. The next word predicted is shown in the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. Information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is also displayed.

#### Note:
The source code for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RHuebner1972/DSCapstone)

Presentation Slide decks are available on the [RPubs page](http://rpubs.com/rhuebner/capstone
